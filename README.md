# âš¡ Smart Illegal Electric Fence Detection â€“ SIH 2025

Electric fences are widely used for security, but unauthorized connections or misuse can cause **electrocution risks** and **power theft**. To tackle this, I developed an **AI/ML model** that predicts **illegal current supplies** and distinguishes **normal household current vs dangerous fence current**. The model analyzes features such as **RMS (Root Mean Square), Pulse Rate, Peak Current, Frequency**, and more, effectively differentiating between household appliances like **fans, bulbs, motors** and illegal fence connections.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features

* **Illegal Current Detection:** Detects attempts to draw current illegally from fences.
* **Appliance Differentiation:** Separates normal appliance currents from dangerous fence currents.
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Uses **Random Forest** with **train-test split** for accurate predictions.
* **IoT Integration Potential:** Can be extended for real-time monitoring using IoT sensors.
* **Safety & Theft Prevention:** Enhances electrical safety and detects power theft efficiently.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Contents

* **Dataset:** Curated dataset used for training the ML model.
* **Notebook & Training Code:** For reproducing, testing, and extending the model.
* **PPT Presentation:** Presented at **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**, covering problem statement, solution, methodology, feasibility, and impact.
